# Note Taker

## Description

This app is used as a way to read, write, and delete notes. We use a db.json file to store the notes that are persistent across sessions. You can easily start with the get started button and then add a title and description for the note. Once both are filled in, a save button will appear. Once you click save it will move into your saved notes with the option to click the note to read it as well as the option to click the red trash can to delete it.
